          <h1>MACHINE DESIGN</h1>
          <h2>Machine Design with Fusion 360 is an annual workshop organizeD by RoboVitics in which the participants are taught how to use the Fusion 360 Software. The participants are introduced to the basics of designing, 2D sketches and drawing, 3D modelling and various other features. For this year’s workshop, participants were taught the assembly and motion study of a radial engine. It was followed by Rendering, which adds aesthetics to the designed 3D models. The design then underwent simulation during which it's behaviour under stress was recorded. Lastly,
they were taught about Generative Designing, a new feature in the design industry.

           <h1>COSMOS 360</h1>
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Cosmos 360 is a design Hackathon conducted for the sole purpose of letting the young minds bring out their creative and innovative ideas. The participants designed
using Fusion 360 software. We hoped to provide the participants a platform to showcase and discover their skills. Participants were given a duration of 24 hours to
work on the problem statements along with their model. The theme was space and thus the name Cosmos, included problem statements like space robotics, solar cell,
manned rover, space transportation system and many more. Cosmos 360 gave the participants a platform to tackle various problems and gain a prolific knowledge of
space.</h2>

           <h1>EQUINOX</h1>
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Equinox is a 36-Hour hackathon. In our unique hackathon, participants' ideas will not be limited by specific problem statements on Web-page development, hardware, Artificial Intelligence etc. This will bring out the creativity in the participants and render the process of ideation more effective. Although, various tracks such as Robotics, Space, Safety and Security, Defense, Healthcare, Financial-Technology, open innovation will be provided under which the participants can choose to compete. Participants are free to choose their own domain, problem statement as well as solution and will be aided in prototyping. We believe innovation thrives under freedom!</h2>

          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Vortex360 is a month-long online design hackathon powered by Autodesk. This hackathon aims to provide a platform to all the design engineers to give form to
their ideas. The completely online hackathon was attended by 420 enthusiastic participants, with 20 teams making it to the final round. The designs that were
realized due course were phenomenal. The Hackathon included over 25 problem statements under 6 domains. To provide extra motivation, the prize pool of
Vortex360 was 55,000 2. All in all, the participants persevered along with the organizers to conduct a one of its kind online hackathon.The hack aims to provide a platform where you can unwrap your skills and your abilities
